Phase 2
========================Tasbir Rahman=====================
I converted all the print statements so that they use the logger.
I added logging to all the events when read. I refactored a lot of
the code so that the names are more descriptive. I also modified the 
documentation of a lot of the code to be more clear and added bits 
and pieces of it throughout the program. I also removed some instances
of hardcoding in WarehouseFloor and WorkerManager. I also did some of 
the walkthrough as well.

========================Peijun Ma=========================
I wrote all of the unit tests for phase 2 except for WorkerTest. I also
implemented the rescan method in Worker.

I created and implemented some unittests. I redid half the UML with Andrew doing the other 
half. I helped find and tweak smaller bugs as I came across them. We all contributed to making
design decisions.

========================Andrew Olechtchouk=========================
I created, implemented, and documented the Abstract Worker class,
the Sequencer class (up until we made some design changes near the end),
and also the “generic software” that included the optimize method. I wrote
test cases for these classes and also updated the UML diagram after each
design change. We all took part in the design decisions for the program.
