Phase 1
========================Tasbir Rahman=====================
I converted all the print statements so that they use the logger.
I added logging to all the events when read. I refactored a lot of
the code so that the names are more descriptive. I also modified the 
documentation of a lot of the code to be more clear and added bits 
and pieces of it throughout the program. I also added the minStock
field to warehouse floor because replenishing when stock levels
reach 5 is hardcoding. I made tests for the classes I created in 
phase 1.

========================Peijun Ma=========================
I created, implemented, and documented the Main,
CsvReadWrite, Simulator and Replenisher classes and all associated
methods. I also implemented getAllSku method in SkuTranslator. I was keeping
track of the UML diagram in the beginning until Andrew took over.
Everyone in my group was involved in fixing
various tiny mistakes in other classes such as a subclass
not extending its parent or doing style fixes. We all took
part in the design decisions for the program. I also handled
some of the debugging near the end.

==================Venkata Chaitanya Peesapati===================
I created, implemented, and documented the Loader, Truck and Order classes.
I also implemented some of the methods in the Warehouse class.
I created and wrote the help.txt file. I was also noting down any 
important design decisions that were made during our discussions.
Everyone the group was involved in fixing various tiny mistakes 
in other files. We all took part in the design decisions for the
program. I helped contribute to some of the testing done at the end.

========================Andrew Olechtchouk=========================
I created, implemented, and documented the Abstract Worker class,
the Sequencer class (up until we made some design changes near the end),
and also the “generic software” that included the optimize method. I wrote
test cases for these classes and also updated the UML diagram after each
design change. We all took part in the design decisions for the program.

Phase 2
========================Peijun Ma=========================
I wrote all of the unit tests for phase 2 except for WorkerTest. I also
implemented the rescan method in Worker.
