========================Tasbir Rahman=====================
I created, impelemented, and documented the SkuTranslator, 
PickingRequest, and Picker classes and all associated 
methods (except for one in SkuTranslator). I also wrote 
the three methods for assigning workers to do certain 
requests. Everyone in my group was involved in fixing 
various tiny mistakes in other classes such as a subclass 
not extending its parent or doing style fixes. We all took
part in the design decisions for the program. I also handled 
some of the debugging near the end.
