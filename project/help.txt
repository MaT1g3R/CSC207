This tutorial assumes you have already cloned the repo and changed directory to repo/project. 

The following commands should be entered into the terminal to compile and execute the program:
-------------------
cd src
javac util/Main.java
java util/Main
-------------------

After this, the program should run and automatically select files for input.
It will output to orders.csv and final.csv in the same directory.
