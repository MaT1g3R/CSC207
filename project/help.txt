This tutorial assumes you have already cloned the repo and changed directory to repo/project. 

The following commands should be entered into the terminal to compile and execute the program:
-------------------
cd src
javac util/Main.java
-------------------

We have provided 3 different event files, to run simulation on one of them,
use one of the following commands:
-------------------
java util/Main ../events.txt
java util/Main ../rescan_demo.txt
java util/Main ../fail_demo.txt
-------------------

After this, the program should run and automatically select files for input.
It will output to orders.csv, final.csv and log.txt in project/.
